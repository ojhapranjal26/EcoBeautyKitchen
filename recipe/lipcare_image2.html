        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">5 Recipes for Making a Hydrating Face Mask</h2> -->
        <p>This easy-to-make (3 ingredients!) DIY lip stain makes the prettiest color for your lips—and it works for cheeks, too! Beet powder creates a natural color, and the combination of shea butter and castor oil makes a super-nourishing base that's lightweight and perfect for summer. If you've read this blog for long, then you know we make a lot of stuff. I mean, you should see my bathroom. It's a nightmare of bottles and jars of concoctions to test out. Some make the cut, and some sit for so long I completely forget what's in them (apparently that's what labels are for).

            But this lip + cheek stain recipe is one I am so excited about. Because I love, love, love it. I'm all about 'no makeup' in the summer. Multi-use makeup that I can apply with my finger is even better.
            
            Just swipe on your lips and cheeks for a healthy pink glow. It goes on easily and feels somewhere between a lip balm and a lip gloss. </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

        <p>Castor oil — Castor oil is very hydrating (it works great on eyelashes) and has a nice, thick texture that makes this recipe feel smooth and glossy. It is known for preserving moisture, and its fatty acids leave the skin feeling nourished.

            Shea butter — Shea butter is such a silky, creamy ingredient. It provides healing moisture and also gives the blush its staying power on the lips and cheeks.
            
            Beetroot powder — Using beetroot powder for coloring is the perfect natural option for getting a rosy glow. Plus, beetroot contains anti-inflammatory compounds and powerful antioxidants called phytochemicals that heal damaged cells [source]. </p>

            <p class="image-caption"></p>
        </div>

        
        <p>Start by combining the shea butter and castor oil in a heat-proof measuring cup placed in a small saucepan filled with about an inch of water.
        <br>Heat over low heat until the shea butter is melted, then give it a good stir. Add the beetroot powder and give it another stir.
    <br>
    You may find that the beet powder wants to sink to the bottom as the mixture cools (especially if the oils are hot when you add the powder). If so, continue stirring the lip stain as it cools to keep the colorant evenly dispersed.

           <br>When the mixture reaches a solid but still pourable consistency (like honey), transfer it to a clean jar or cosmetic tin. Then let it cool to room temperature.

           
           </p>
           <h2 class="section-heading">Substitutions</h2>

        <p>Essentially, you need a liquid oil, a solid vegetable butter, and a colorant to make lip stain. Here are a few ways to substitute:

            Oil options — In place of the castor oil, feel free to use sweet almond, avocado, olive or jojoba oil.
            
            Butter options — If you can't get your hands on shea butter, try using cocoa butter or mango butter.
            
            Color — Don't be afraid to experiment with the color. Add more beetroot powder or try freeze-dried strawberries or raspberries, which can be ground into a fine powder using a coffee grinder. You can also use cranberry or pomegranate powders.
            
            There are a variety of herbs, spices, or mica powders you can use to tweak the color to match your skin tone.
            
                Cinnamon, for example, will give you a more terracotta hue. Plus, it can naturally plump your lips—just be careful to not overdo it and irritate them too much!
                A little pinch of turmeric will make the color more suited to those with yellow undertones.
                If you have cooler undertones, look for blue or purple powders, like butterfly pea powder, to give it a cooler hue.
