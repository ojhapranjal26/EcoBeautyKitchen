        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">5 Recipes for Making a Hydrating Face Mask</h2> -->
        <p>Have you ever exfoliated your lips? Well, ladies (and gents), today is the day to raid the kitchen for a simple DIY sugar lip scrub. In under 5 minutes, you can exfoliate dry skin and enjoy soft, kissable lips all day.

            A honey and sugar lip scrub combines exfoliation with much-needed moisture to keep lips softer for longer, even in cold winter weather. So get on the lip scrub wagon with these homemade recipes and follow with a homemade lip balm. There are endless ways to make a tasty sugar lip scrub. Just grab yourself a small bowl, a spoon, and any ingredients you've got hanging out in your pantry like skin-soothing oils, moisturizing honey, and nourishing add-ins like cocoa powder and strawberries.

            If you'd like to get fancy, keep reading, and we'll show you how to make a lip scrub using our no-fail customizable formula to keep your lips soft, smooth, and healthy.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">No-Fail Sugar Lip Scrub Recipe</h2>

        <p>Homemade sugar lip scrubs are super easy to whip up and require just a few ingredients. But this recipe is a classic!

            A little honey combined with sugar and almond oil is all you need to moisturize and slough off dead skin. <br>
        
    The main ingredient is sugar, which serves as an exfoliant to remove dead skin cells from your lips.
    You'll also need a moisturizing agent, such as honey, coconut oil, or shea butter, to help keep your lips soft and supple.
    Finally, you can add some extras, like a few drops of lip-loving essential oils or other flavorings to give your lip scrub a delicious scent. You can also add vanilla extract for added sweetness.
<br>
You can make things even simpler by leaving out the oil and going with a honey lip scrub. While you can use any kind of honey you like, the raw stuff has nutrients and antioxidants that nourish skin and encourage healing [source].</p>

        <p>Combine your chosen ingredients in a small bowl. You'll want a consistency that's gritty enough to exfoliate but not too dry. You'll be tempted to eat the mixture because it tastes pretty darn good!
        <br>Step 1: Add 1 teaspoon honey
        Add 1 teaspoon honey to sugar lip scrub recipe
        
        Honey is the ultimate lip medicine. It soothes dry, chapped lips by drawing moisture from the air and depositing it into the skin.
        
        It also has tons of antioxidants and can bring relief to irritated lips because of a mild antiseptic effect that speeds up the healing of small cuts or burns.
        
        You can use any one of the following to make your scrub:
        Raw honey
        Manuka honey
        Maple syrup or molasses (both make great vegan alternatives to honey!)
    <br>
    Step 2: Add 2 teaspoons sugar 
            
    Sugar in your beauty routine isn't a no-no like in your diet. Sugar body scrubs are cheap and easy to make because the ingredients are probably in your pantry already.

    Plus, sugar is gentle enough to polish sensitive areas like the face and lips. Fine granulated sugar is usually the best choice for lip scrubs because its small crystals are gentle on the delicate skin of the lips. Brown sugar, being softer and finer, is also a good option for extra-sensitive skin.

    Brown sugar
    White granulated sugar
    Superfine caster sugar

           <br> Step 3: Add 1 teaspoon carrier oil
            
           Add a bit of carrier oil to add moisture to your scrub and hydrate your lips. Any oil that stays liquid at room temperature will work.

           A study assessing the use of coconut and olive oil on lips showed good penetration of the surface skin and measured over 6 hours of moisturizing ability [source]. I love jojoba, grapeseed, argan, and rosehip oils because of their ability to repair the skin barrier and regenerative properties [source].
           
           You only need a tiny amount, so stick with one of the basic oils you've already got on hand.
           
               Almond oil
               Olive oil
               Coconut oil
               Jojoba oil
           <br>Step 4: Add optional extras
            
           You can't go wrong sticking with just sugar and honey for your lips, but sometimes you want to get experimental in the beauty test kitchen.
