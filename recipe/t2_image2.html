        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">5 Recipes for Making a Hydrating Face Mask</h2> -->
        <p>Imagine a skincare product that can hydrate, soothe, brighten, and improve the overall texture of your skin—all in one bottle. Well that's exactly what this rice water toner does. When combined with the skincare powerhouses niacinamide and glycerin, this simple toner becomes a luxurious, rejuvenating potion that can nourish your complexion and soothe your skin. In homemade beauty recipes, sometimes the most transformative elixirs come from humble origins. Case in point: rice water. Made by soaking rice in water and then straining out the rice, the nutrient-rich water that's leftover has beauty-boosting properties for your hair and skin.

            And one of the easiest ways to incorporate this ingredient is in a homemade toner recipe that helps even out your complexion and lighten age spots.</p>

        <p>Rice Water — Rice water is the liquid that remains after soaking or boiling rice. Loaded with vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, rice water has been used in skincare for centuries, especially in Asian beauty traditions. While studies are lacking, it's said to hydrate and soothe the skin, reduce redness and inflammation, and leave you with a radiant complexion. 
        
            <br>Niacinamide — Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3, which, when used in skincare products like toners, can help improve the skin's elasticity, reduce redness and inflammation, and help decrease acne. It is also known for its ability to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and fade hyperpigmentation [source].<br>
            Glycerin — Glycerin is a humectant, which means it attracts moisture from the environment and helps retain it on the skin's surface. It provides instant and long-lasting moisture, so skin feels softer and smoother. Plus, it helps to create a protective barrier on the skin, preventing moisture loss and protecting the skin from environmental stressors.

           <h2 class="section-heading">Instructions</h2>

        <p>There are many different ways to make rice water. The easiest way, and the one that we use here, is to simply soak rice in water for 30 minutes to an hour. If you're in a hurry you can also boil it on the stove, strain out the rice and set the water aside to cool completely.

            The leftover liquid is what makes the base of this hydrating facial toner. 

            Place rinsed rice in a clean bowl and add water. Allow the rice to soak for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. During this time, the water will absorb some of the rice's nutrients and become cloudy. That's what you want! <br>
            After half an hour, strain the rice water into a separate container, discarding the rice itself (or saving it to cook and eat later, if you like). The strained liquid is your rice water. Add niacinamide and glycerin to the mixture. Stir well to ensure that they're evenly distributed throughout the rice water. Transfer the prepared rice water toner to a clean, empty bottle or container. A small spray bottle works well for easy application. Or a lidded bottle will work if you plan to apply the toner using a cotton round.</p>
